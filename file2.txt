Please make sure you create the files exactly as shown here. Make sure you break the lines at
the same locations and that you don’t introduce extra whitespace characters. It is recommended
to copy and paste the content.
After creating the files add and commit them to Git with the following commands (Don’t forget to
cd into the directory before trying these commands):
git add file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
git commit -m “initial set of files”
We will now push the commit we just created directly into the “main” branch of our Git
repository. This is something that a maintainer can typically do, but that is usually avoided in
real software projects because it bypasses the code review and CI mechanisms.
git push origin
Once we’re done pushing, we should be able to see the new files from the GitHub UI.
Contributor task 1: Fork the repository
Once the repository and the initial set of files are created by the maintainer, the contributor can
fork the repository to his own GitHub account.
